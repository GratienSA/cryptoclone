As a software developer, your task is to create a well-configured Next.js app.

Start by analyzing the necessary packages required for building a robust application.

You will need to establish a solid directory structure to organize and host your code effectively.

Develop the app by creating essential pages and components. You will need to handle API requests, ensuring that both successes and failures are properly managed.

Users should be able to connect or register for your app, with the option to use a promo code.

Enable users to buy cryptocurrency either from a platform or directly from another user. This involves creating functionality for listing and selling cryptocurrencies.

The app should also provide features to view the latest trades, list all available cryptocurrencies, and search for specific cryptocurrencies.

On the admin side, you will handle various tasks including creating new cryptocurrencies and promo codes, as well as viewing user crypto assets and available cash balances.
